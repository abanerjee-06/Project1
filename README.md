# Sherlock Holmes Webpage

This repository aims to provide the user with a basic understanding of web-development. Written primarily in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it helps include some basic functionalities to the webpage. <br><br>

## Topic of the Webpage
I am a fan of the fictitious detective Sherlock Holmes. I have watched some of the recent renditions of the various short stories written by the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. So, I thought why not make a webpage about this famous personality. <br>
Most of the images used in the design are from the BBC series **Sherlock** where the sleuth is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman plays the role of Dr. Watson. <br>

## How to run the code:
CSS is used only for styling the pages. HTML for writing the main content. JavaScript has the role for adding some functionality to the webpage, like adding an alert on immediate entry to the website. The main content is divided into a ***js***, ***images*** folders and the html and css files in the main directory. There are four HTML pages:

	 1. index.html (The main page)
	 2. location.html (Address of the detective)
	 3. sleuth.html (About Mr. Holmes)
	 4. author.html (About Sir Arthur)

There are hyperlinks to navigate between the various webpages. All one has to do is to **download the repository** from the URL given below and double-click on **index.html**.  <br>

It is very easy to execute and run the files. Hope this repository helps best serve the intentions for which it was built.
